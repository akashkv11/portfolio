          <h2 class="hidden">The Beginning: A Curious Click</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            Hi there! I'm Akash, and like many developers, my journey started
            with pure curiosity. I was scrolling through Facebook one day during
            my college years when I accidentally hit F12. Suddenly, this
            mysterious panel opened up showing all this code. Out of curiosity,
            I found where it said "Facebook" in the HTML and changed it to my
            own name. When I saw my edit appear on the page, I literally sat
            there staring at the screen in disbelief.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            That moment changed everything. I realized that websites weren't
            just static things that existed—they were built by people like me,
            using code I could actually understand and modify.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="hidden">The Early Days: From Notepad to Passion</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            What really hooked me was discovering how accessible web development
            was. Unlike other programming languages that needed complex IDEs and
            environments, I could create a file with a .html extension, write
            some code in notepad, and instantly see results in any browser. No
            installation wizards, no configuration files—just pure, immediate
            feedback.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I spent hours in those early days just experimenting. I'd write a
            simple HTML page, add some CSS styling, maybe a bit of JavaScript
            for interactivity, and watch my ideas come to life. That immediate
            visual feedback loop became addictive. I wasn't just writing
            abstract code—I was building interfaces, creating experiences.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            During my high school and college computer science courses, while my
            classmates were focused on algorithms and data structures (which I
            appreciate now!), I was always drawn to anything that had a visual
            output. I wanted to see my code work in the real world, not just
            pass test cases.

            The API Discovery: Building My First Real Project
          </h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            One of my most memorable early projects happened when I stumbled
            across a list of public APIs online. I was amazed—here were these
            services that could provide me with real data! I found several
            image-fetching APIs with different categories and thought, "What if
            I could build a gallery app that pulls images from these APIs?"
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            So I did. I built an image gallery where users could select
            different categories—nature, technology, abstract art—and the app
            would dynamically fetch and display images in a responsive grid
            layout. It wasn't just a static webpage anymore; it was a living,
            breathing application that interacted with real data sources.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            The best part was showing it to friends and family. Watching their
            faces when they clicked a category and saw fresh images populate
            instantly—that's when I knew I had found my calling. I wasn't just
            coding; I was creating experiences that people could enjoy and
            interact with.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2 class="hidden">My Development Philosophy</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            For me, the most exciting part of programming isn't solving abstract
            problems—it's seeing the output as something tangible, something
            that connects with the real world. I love that moment when your code
            transforms from lines of text into a living interface that people
            can actually use.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            This is why I gravitated toward full-stack development. I enjoy
            understanding the complete flow: how data moves from the database
            through the backend APIs, gets processed and transformed, then
            renders beautifully on the frontend. There's something satisfying
            about being able to trace a user's click all the way through the
            entire system architecture.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I'm passionate about writing clean, maintainable code that follows
            best practices like SOLID principles. But I also believe that great
            code should serve great user experiences. Technical excellence and
            user satisfaction should go hand in hand, not compete with each
            other.

            Professional Journey: Growth at Reon Technologies
          </h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            At Reon Technologies, I've had the opportunity to work on
            challenging, real-world applications with actual users and business
            impact. Over my 2+ years here, I've been able to deliver measurable
            improvements: 30% faster frontend performance and 25% higher team
            productivity through code reviews, knowledge sharing, and
            streamlining our development processes.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            But beyond the metrics, what I'm most proud of is how I've grown as
            a mentor and team player. I've helped onboard new developers, led
            code review sessions, and contributed to improving our Agile
            processes and CI/CD pipelines. There's something deeply satisfying
            about not just writing better code yourself, but helping your entire
            team level up.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I've worked extensively with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js,
            React, Node.js), but I've also explored other technologies based on
            project needs. I believe in choosing the right tool for the job, not
            just defaulting to what you know.

          <h2 class="hidden">The Learning Never Stops</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            One thing that drives me is the constant evolution of web
            development. There's always a new framework, a better way to solve
            an old problem, or an emerging technology that opens up new
            possibilities. I love diving into new programming languages,
            frameworks, and technologies—not just to add them to my resume, but
            because each one teaches you to think about problems differently.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I maintain a habit of building small experimental projects to test
            out new technologies. Whether it's trying out a new React feature,
            experimenting with a different database solution, or exploring the
            latest CSS capabilities, I believe hands-on experimentation is the
            best way to truly understand new tools.

          <h2 class="hidden">Mentoring: Sharing the Journey</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            Teaching others has become a significant part of my development
            journey. Whether it's helping teammates debug complex issues,
            explaining architectural decisions to junior developers, or sharing
            knowledge about both technical and non-technical topics, I find
            mentoring incredibly rewarding.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            There's something special about that moment when you're explaining a
            concept and you see the lightbulb go on in someone else's eyes—it
            reminds me of my own "aha!" moment with that Facebook inspect
            element. I believe knowledge becomes more valuable when it's shared,
            and helping others grow makes the entire development community
            stronger.

          <h2 class="hidden">Beyond the Screen: Life, Football, and Balance</h2>
          <p class="hidden">
            When I step away from the computer, you'll most likely find me on a
            football pitch. Football is my other passion—the strategic plays,
            the teamwork, the split-second decisions, and the satisfaction of
            executing the perfect move. In many ways, football and coding share
            similarities: they both require strategic thinking, collaboration,
            and the ability to adapt quickly when things don't go according to
            plan.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I consider myself an ambivert, which serves me well in development.
            I enjoy focused, deep-work coding sessions where I can dive into
            complex problems, but I also thrive in collaborative environments
            where we're brainstorming solutions, conducting code reviews, or
            planning architecture decisions as a team.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I'm someone who finds humor in both the frustrations and victories
            of coding life—from spending hours debugging only to find a missing
            semicolon, to the satisfaction of finally getting a complex feature
            working perfectly. I think maintaining a sense of humor is essential
            in this field where things break in mysterious ways and requirements
            change at the last minute.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            The people who matter most to me are my family and my girlfriend,
            who've supported my passion for technology and my continuous
            learning journey. They've listened patiently to my excited
            explanations of new projects, celebrated my career victories, and
            provided perspective during challenging times.

          <p class="hidden">
            I'm seeking a role where I can continue pushing the boundaries of
            what's possible with web technology. I want to work with a team that
            values both technical excellence and user experience, where I can
            contribute to products that make a real difference in people's
            lives.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            I'm excited about opportunities to work with emerging technologies,
            tackle complex architectural challenges, and continue growing as
            both a developer and a mentor. I believe the best software is built
            by teams that combine technical skill with genuine care for the
            users they serve.
          </p>
          <p class="hidden">
            My ideal role would allow me to contribute to meaningful projects
            while continuing to learn, grow, and help others along their
            development journeys. After all, that's what got me started in the
            first place—curiosity, learning, and the desire to build something
            that matters.
